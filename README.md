This was a javaScript project , to study the fundamentals and funtionality of javaScript Properties

here is how it works :
  1 . Use 'Space Bar' to jump the bird
  2 . There are some obsticles which should not hit the bird, 
      If it hits the pipe or obsticle the game ends.
  3 . after game refesh to play the game again
  
Still to improve many things......
      
thankyou.
